# Pentium notes
## To-do List
- [DONE: settings and autocomplete runs less often] Do any optimization needed to squeeze more FPS juice
- [DONE: boolean, string, number] Create some more settings types for people who want to expand Pentium without doing all of that themselves
- Linting (if i can figure it out and make it not suck)
- Make autocomplete smarter so it recognizes a path instead of trying to search the whole line

## Notes
- The code header was originally a way to visually display error messages and important info through Pentium's logging system but it never worked so I removed it.
  It may come back in the future.
- vLua was removed because I don't like it
