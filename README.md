# Pentium
Pentium is a developer tool to help you do quick coding while in-game. It was created because the Developer Console (F9) doesn't support any fancy code editing features.
You can get Pentium from the [Releases](https://github.com/sirkingbinx/Pentium) page or from the [Roblox Studio Marketplace](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations/store/105554102861681)
